# Pong

#### To run the game, clone the repo, and in the command line run ```python pong.py``` and get to playing! Build with Python 2.7.13.

__Built With:__
  * Python
  * Pygame
  * [Sounds](http://cs.au.dk/~dsound/DigitalAudio.dir/Greenfoot/Pong.dir/Pong.html)

Using [Trevor Appleton's Tutorial](http://trevorappleton.blogspot.com/2014/04/writing-pong-using-python-and-pygame.html) as a reference point and then modified it to be more like the original pong game. It's a great project to start with to get familiar with Pygame!

Changes I made include:
  * Adding scoring when the player or computer misses the ball
  * Changing the computer algorithm so it doesn't hit the ball every time
  * Added original Pong sound effects
