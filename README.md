#### To run the game, clone the repo, and in the command line run ```python pong.py``` and get to playing!

For the base project I followed [Trevor Appleton's Tutorial](http://trevorappleton.blogspot.com/2014/04/writing-pong-using-python-and-pygame.html) and then modified it to be more like the original pong game. It's a great project to start with to get familiar with Pygame!

Changes I made include:
  * Adding scoring when the player or computer misses the ball
  * Changing the computer algorithm so it isn't able to hit the ball every time
  * Added original Pong sound effects
